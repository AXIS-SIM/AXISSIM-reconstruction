# AXISSIM-reconstruction

This repository provides the custom MATLAB reconstruction algorithm developed for the paper titled:
"Near-isotropic Super-Resolution Microscopy with Axial Interference Speckle Illumination."
AXIS-SIM stands for Axial Interference Speckle (AXIS)-engineered Structured Illumination Microscopy.

## Dataset
Due to file size limitations, the test dataset is hosted on Figshare and can be downloaded from the following link:
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/AXIS-SIM_dataset/29816543

## How to Run
To reproduce the reconstruction:
1. Download and unzip the Figshare dataset into the `AXIS-SIM data` folder.
2. Open `AXIS_main_reconstruction.m` in MATLAB R2021b.
3. Run the script. 

## Parameters
All parameters used to reproduce the cellular imaging experiments in the paper are pre-set in the provided code.

## System Requirements
We recommend MATLAB R2021b. All required functions are included in the repository, and no additional installation is necessary. 

# Notes
Please refer to our paper for detailed descriptions of the reconstruction algorithm and imaging experiments.
